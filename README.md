## Introduction
This project is focused on the classification of brain tumors using MRI scans. It aims to assist doctors in diagnosing brain tumors by providing a reliable, automated classification system.

## Project Overview
The Brain Tumor Classification project involves the development of a deep learning model that classifies MRI brain scans into different tumor types. This project leverages various deep learning techniques and tools to achieve high accuracy in classification.

## Features
- **Automatic Tumor Classification**: Classifies brain tumors into predefined categories.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A web-based interface for doctors and patients.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing new MRI scans in real-time.
- **Visualizations**: Displays heatmaps to highlight regions of interest in the MRI scans.

## Dataset
- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset .
- **Structure**: This dataset contains 7023 images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes: glioma - meningioma - no tumor and pituitary.
- **Preprocessing**: 'to be written'.

## Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: ResNet50, VGG16, and a custom CNN.
- **Layers**: 'to be written'.
- **Training**: 'to be written'.

## Installation
Provide a step-by-step guide to setting up the project locally.
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amrhany9/VisBrain.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd VisBrain
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
